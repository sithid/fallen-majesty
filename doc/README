This is the README file for the Dystopia 1.0.1 codebase.

At the release of Dystopia 1.0.1 the following problems where know :

** The ban code is a bit buggy, banning anyone who is connected to the
   mud, or trying to connect can cause the mud to crash.
   Besides that, the ban code works perfectly :)

** You will notice (if you read the code), that some types of attacks vs
   mobs CANNOT do more than the victims hp-1 damage, this is done to
   prevent fightlag (char_list get's messed up a bit during that round
   of combat, preventing the rest of the chars in char_list to get a round
   of combat). DO NOT change this, unless you know what you are doing, and
   made a little helper in violence_update().

** When a quest card is completed, it sometimes (very rarely) thinks that
   it still needs an item (named Om), which doesn't exist. I'm doing a
   recode of the questcards commands do_complete and spell_quest_card,
   sometime soon. (some of the items on the list doesn't exist, remove those)

** Hostlookup in comm.c is not threaded. This is only a problem if a player
   tries to connect from a connection with a DNS problem. I have made an
   exception in comm.c that takes care of the problem with these connections,
   but if any new connections is discovered that causes these problems, they
   should be added to the list in comm.c

** The mud leaks a little memory, if you happen to find any leaks, mail them
   to me, and you'll get credited in the next release.

** The code has been tested on Redhat linux 6.1 and Slackware 5.3, and compiles
   without any errors on these platforms (kernel 2.0.34 and 2.2.14).
   I do in no way promise that this code will compile, but I have never had
   any problems with it, on any of the machines I have compiled it on.


In the 1.0.1 release, these are some of the things you should be aware of :

** Train all, for hp, move and mana CAN bypass the statcap, this is NOT a bug,
   but if don't want it to be like this, feel free to change the loop in act_move.c
   to reflect this. We kept it like this in Dystopia to rewars the players that
   took the risk of wandering around with 1.000.000.000+ exp (you loose half
   when you get capped), With a 100K statcap a player could get as far as
   120K with a good train.

** Clanlist and Showkingdesc only shows kingdoms that aren't named <null>, so
   inactive kingdoms can be removed from these lists by using clanset.
