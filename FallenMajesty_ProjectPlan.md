# Fallen Majesty MUD Project Plan

## Purpose and Goals
This document outlines the strategy for cleaning, documenting, and modernizing the Fallen Majesty MUD C codebase. The primary goals include:
- Removing unused, unfinished, or dead code.
- Thoroughly documenting the codebase for future maintainability.
- Refactoring for modern C coding standards and best practices.
- Creating a clean, well-documented, independent C codebase that can be maintained long-term.
- Ensuring the codebase compiles cleanly and runs reliably.

## Codebase Analysis

### Structure Overview
The codebase is organized into several directories including:
- `src/`: Contains key source files and a `Makefile` for building the `dystopia` binary.
   - Focus on files like `merc.h`, `interp.c`, `psionist.c`.
   - Approximately 150,000 lines of code.
- `area/`: Houses world content and game data in `.are` files and other text-based configurations.
- `doc/`: Documentation-related files, including licensing information.

### Key Features
- **Character Classes**: Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, and more.
- **Clan System**: Management of clans and warfare.
- **Combat System**: Advanced fighting mechanics.
- **OLC**: Online world building.
- **Quest System**: Dynamic quests and missions.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Cleanup and Removal (Current Phase)
Systematic cleanup of the codebase to remove clutter and unused elements:
- Remove unused structures, macros, and definitions
- Eliminate commented-out code blocks
- Remove dead code and unfinished features
- Clean up stale comments and outdated documentation
- Standardize formatting and naming conventions
- Focus on making the codebase lean and maintainable

### Phase 2: Documentation and Modernization (After Cleanup)
Comprehensive documentation and enhancement of the cleaned codebase:
- Document all major functions, structures, and systems
- Create architectural overview and system interaction diagrams
- Write developer guides and maintenance documentation
- Apply modern C coding standards where appropriate
- Enhance error handling and memory management
- Create build and deployment guides

## Refactoring Plan

### Unused Code Removal

Cleaned up old `CON_NOTE_TEXT` system references that were replaced by the newer `CON_EDITING` system. Removed commented code at lines 610-613, 1101-1103, and 1154-1156. System now uses modern editing interface without legacy code clutter.
- **2025-07-22** - Session wrap-up due to context window limits - Multiple files - Successfully completed extensive cleanup across multiple core files including merc.h, db.c, comm.c, act_info.c, act_move.c, interp.c, and fight.c. Removed obsolete code while preserving game functionality. Need fresh session to continue cleanup work.
- **2025-07-22** - Database loading system cleanup (Phase 1) - `src/db.c` - Began systematic cleanup of db.c (~3800 lines), the central database and loading system. Removed commented-out legacy `fread_to_eol` function (lines ~3034-3059) and replaced with comment noting safer replacement version. Removed commented-out legacy `fread_word` function (lines ~3060-3097) and replaced with comment noting safer EOF-checking version. Both legacy functions were replaced by safer implementations that include proper EOF checking to prevent crashes during area file loading.

The function contained a complete werewolf howl command implementation with vampire/werewolf class checks, channel handling, message broadcasting, and distance-based message variations. Code was completely commented out and no longer in use. Removal significantly improves file maintainability and reduces code clutter. All active wizard commands preserved and build verified successful.
- **2025-07-23** - `src/db.c` additional cleanup - **COMPLETED** further refinement of database core file including: removed excessive empty lines between functions (lines ~867, 1234, 1955), consolidated repetitive `/* Unused */` comments in mobile loading section into cleaner format with explanatory comments, standardized inconsistent indentation in special artifact tracking section (lines 1037-1058), combined duplicate ITEMAFFENTROPY checks, and improved overall code consistency. All database functionality preserved while improving maintainability.
- **2025-07-23** - `src/save.c` cleanup completion - **COMPLETED** comprehensive cleanup of the character save/load system (~2800+ lines). Removed unprofessional comments ("Dh Crap", "Lala"), standardized all comment styles to consistent C-style formatting, enhanced comment quality by replacing cryptic "dragons" comments with descriptive text ("dragon heritage", "dragon age", "dragon hatching data"), improved legacy format comments ("Obsolete 2.0 form" → "Legacy affect format"), and cleaned up code formatting throughout.

All spell mechanics preserved while significantly improving code maintainability and readability.
- **2025-07-23** - `src/update.c` cleanup completion - **COMPLETED** comprehensive cleanup of the character update and game tick system (~2400+ lines). Removed extensive commented-out legacy code including old debugging blocks, obsolete timer functionality, and dead code remnants. Standardized mixed comment styles from C-style to modern format. Improved comment professionalism by replacing unclear comments (e.g., "This one's to keep Zarkas quiet ;)" became "Reduced damage for serpent form"). This critical file handles character regeneration, mob actions, game timers, and all tick-based updates essential for game functionality. All game mechanics preserved while dramatically improving code clarity and maintainability.
- **2025-07-23** - `src/clan.c` cleanup completion - **COMPLETED** comprehensive cleanup of clan system file (~5390 lines). Removed extensive commented-out legacy code blocks including obsolete NPC restriction checks, level requirement checks, polymorph flag system remnants, vampire class modifications, discipline restrictions, and Bear totem requirements. Standardized unprofessional comments by replacing developer-specific references like "please inform KaVir" with professional "please report this issue" messaging. Added concise explanatory comments for legacy code removal. Preserved "Monkcrap" variable name as specifically requested. This critical file handles clan management, vampire disciplines, werewolf abilities, character transformations, and complex game mechanics. All game functionality preserved while dramatically improving code professionalism and maintainability.
- **2025-07-23** - Cleanup assessment and prioritization - **ANALYSIS** Analyzed entire codebase structure using Makefile dependencies and project history. Identified that 16 major core files have been completed including all act_*.c files, core systems (db.c, interp.c, handler.c, save.c, magic.c, update.c, clan.c), and main header (merc.h). Prioritized remaining work: HIGH PRIORITY core files needing cleanup are const.c (constants/tables), string.c (string utilities), special.c (special procedures), olc.c (online building), and mem.c (memory management). MEDIUM PRIORITY includes bit.c, build.c, copyover.c, hashstr.c, and olc components. Class-specific files (vamp.c, garou.c, mage.c, etc.) identified as lower priority but still important. Phase 1 cleanup is approximately 70% complete with most critical infrastructure files done.
- **2025-07-23** - `src/const.c` cleanup completion - **COMPLETED** comprehensive cleanup of constants and data tables file (~2061 lines). Removed commented-out legacy spell entries including "jailwater" and "teleport" entries from skill_table, fixed missing structure commas in slay_table (between entries like "vict_msg" and "room_msg"), replaced developer-specific comment "Spells added by KaVir" with professional note about extended spells section, and removed inappropriate liquid entries ("cum", "cunt juice") from liq_table while preserving legitimate game content. Updated liquid indexing from 18 entries to 16 entries. This critical file contains all game constants, skill/spell definitions, liquid properties, slay messages, and core data tables essential for game mechanics. All functional game data preserved while dramatically improving code professionalism and maintainability. Build verified successful with no compilation errors.
