#RE#rntrance #Rt#ro #RH#rell#n~
A blood curdling scream fills this hollowed out cave. It sounds as if
it is coming from the north, in the far distance. Behind the walls of
darkness and the little red beady eyes that give the hairs on your neck
a good stretch. These little red eyes seem to surround you, everywhere.
The darkness is almost consuming without them. Some bad things must be
going on here and it would probably be a good idea not to stick around
to hear the details.

The remains of fallen warriors are littered about, ones who tried to
make it to Satan and failed. By the looks of it, they didn't put up
much of a fight. It looks like a mortal slaughter-house. Everywhere
you move, the errie feeling that someone if watching you grows more
and more intense. The little red beady eyes have disappeared but you
know they are there, watching, waiting, and closing in on you!

You move deeper into the darkness, vision is not an option, stumbling
seems to be the more appropriate word for it. Skulls seem to be what
is littered about, or that is what they feel like. Every movement is
harder and harder to take as fear begins to corrode your soul.

Corpses line the sides of the walkway, the smell is absolutely foul. The
smell of burning flesh fills your nostrils. There is quite a bit of
light in this room, it almost makes you wish there wasn't. You see pale
translucent figures moving about moaning and screaming. Sorrow seems to
fill these caves.

You see little demons moving about, collecting these pale figures into
jars and dancing about to the north. The screams have subsided, the sound
of chanting can be heard, nothing distinct, but it doesn't sound good.
Flames fill this room, yet it doesn't feel hot. Your soul seems to be
making you move north, as if you are drawn by leash.

This chamber is decorated with all kinds of ritualistic items of evil,
ones that would make a priest ponder his faith in god. In the middle of
the chamber is the throne of the one, the only, anti-christ. He is here
spouting out words of dishonesty and half-truths. As he is speaking you
feel your soul being pulled towards him like a moth to the flame. The
feeling is relaxing yet draining. In the distance, you see small demons
with jars crawling up the walls chanting "We have sssssoulsssss, precious
ssssssoulsssss!"

voices in your head screaming, "I MUST LEAVE! My soul is being taken!".
The sounds of chanting can be heard below and the scratching of claws
on stone are all around you. Many demons just pass you by, as if you
aren't even there. While others watch, wait, and ATTACK!!

You seem to be getting closer to a chamber, the ceiling is rising as
you move, and the shear number of demons and minions is frightening.
Your soul twinges with pain at every demon that flies by. Every step
flames separate, allowing you to move forward. It is as if someone or
something is expecting you.

remorse fills your lungs as you breathe. Souls are floating around you
urging you not to go any farther. As you look around, you notice you
are surrounded. Demons are lined up in a military fashion, slashing at
the air in a menacing manor. "Your time has come, Mortal!". They shout
in unision.

spawning. It is a rather sick sight to see. Who would have thought it, they
are A-Sexual. The demons turn to you and command their offspring to take
your soul!

cringe when you see an empty jar with your name on it! One of the demons
turns to you and says, "How nice of you to save us the work of retrieving
you soul, we will take that now!".  A flash of red fills the room and
demons appear ready to attack.

#RS#ratan's #R#rThrone #RR#room#n~
The mighty throne of Satan in all it's hateful glory. This room is littered
with souls of mortals who were sent here for "purification". All sorts of
mortal remains have been turned into trophies. Lucifer himself is even
here sitting on his throne spouting out orders to his minions and servants.

You have fallen into some type of chamber below hell. It smells of hate,
greed, and revenge! The walls are painted with blood of all types and
colors. Even your wounds are among these. It might be a good idea to get
out of here before something else bad happens.

#RH#rell's #RR#revenge#n~
Every bit of hate you could ever imagine fills this room. Demons here
are all afraid, yet angry. They turn to you, watching, waiting, and
chanting. Demonic runes are inscribed all over the cave walls, as you
move closer, they glow red.

Whew! that was close, you just barely got away. You stop and check to
see if you still have all your limbs. What a nasty battle that was.
Demons are filling in from below. The bloodshed continues!

You have fallen into some type of pit, knarled bones and skulls litter
the ground. A few demons are here going through the remains looking for
good trophies for Satan. The smell of rotting flesh is so think you
can cut it with your weapon. Movement is a bit of a problem. You see
a few souls floating over thier ravaged corpses crying for God.

You continue into the pit and see a small clearing with demons chanting
to some lesser demon god. It is almost as if they are asking for his
presence. It might be a good idea to leave before he comes. They turn to
you and attack!

Before you is the throne of Baal, one of the most feared demons in the
underworld. He is here sifting through trophies the other demons have
brought him to inspect. He turns to you and says, "Ah, your head would be
a nice trophy for my lord. Yes, yes, you must die now!".
