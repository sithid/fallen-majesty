The Guardian is a large man, towering almost seven feet in height. His armor is polished steel
over chainmail.  His helmet is steel forged in the likeness of a Dragon's head.  His great sword
is huge, a bastard sword, yet obviously wielded like a normal longsword.  His shield has the
markings of a Dragon, and he sits atop a black granite throne.

The blood of innocents is covering the entire perimeter of the altar.
The residents of the temple, however, find it a worthy sacrifice to the
mighty Guardian.  Over in a distant corner, you hear another scream cut
short as one's soul is detached permanently from their body.  Shivering with
both fear and excitement, you wonder what this place of worship could hold
for you.

This appears to be the center of focus of the whole temple and
surrounding area.  Examining the surroundings a bit more, you discover the
reason why - there is a stony looking figure that you, at first, assumed was
a statue of some sort.  One part of this figure is very much alive, though -
the eyes.  They seem to be ablaze with a fire of knowledge, knowledge which
may not have always treated the holder kindly.  The few scattered servants
all bow respectfully after fulfilling their tasks, and dart back out of this
room.

The floor of the temple consists of simple stones, but together, they
make wonderfully intricate patterns, which all seem to get more and more
elaborate as they head towards the center of the temple.  A servant catches
your eye, winks slightly, and cautiously darts into the center.  What does
it hold in store for you?  Only the Guardian knows...

There seem to be more people gathered here than any other room, and
they're all in positions of prostration.  As you scuffle your feet into the
room, more than one of these worshippers look rather annoyed at you, and
shush you and your footfall into reverence.  Why anybody would take these
drastic measures of worship, well...  It's only known by the Gods.

In this room, there are quite a few people.  Some look scared to almost
death, while some are too sick to notice the tools of preparation.  The
feeling that they aren't going to last much longer, though, whether the
cause of death be illness or sacrifice, is cold in the pit of your stomach. 
You shiver and try to make your way out of this room as quickly as possible.

This is unlike any lawn that you have seen.  The luscious green-ness of
it hits you like a burst of fresh air emerging from a tomb.  You inhale the
freshness, and wish that you could stay here forever.  The peasants are all
clamoring about seeing the almighty Guardian who reigns here.

Carved around this well, there are figures of very prestigious figures. 
Oddly, one of them seems to wink at you as you glance at it a bit longer
than the others.  This one happens to be in the form of a woman with a kind
of natural, righteous beauty.  She then stills, making you wonder if it ever
even happened at all...

This well radiates a feeling of stability.  The mighty figures that are
carved into the edge all have an unsaid authority about them, not to mention
excellent physique.  You take a sip from the well, giving into your dream of
robust hardiness.

Glancing down at the still waters of this well, excellence seems to
reverberate throughout the air around you.  A proud ruler forms from the
waters, radiating civility and honor, then drops back down into the
once-again still pool.  You cautiously dip down a finger and suck on it
thoughtfully, hoping to inherit some of the qualities it obviously must
possess.

Strangely, as you stand here and peer down into the clear-watered well,
you are overcome by a sense of valor and bravery.  The waters seem to swirl
and reform into pictures of bold characters performing heroic tasks.  You
can't help but want to taste these magical waters.

This appears to be one of two different thoroughfares to the temple.  The
cobble street seems fairly used, and the constant stream of peasants
enforces this conclusion.  Questions of what - or who - they're streaming to

guarded towers, and wonder what the need is for such enforcement.

The coldness of this room is not generated by the weather, but by its
inhabitants.  They are completely disciplined, not even blinking or
twitching a muscle.  After staring at these not-quite-human forms, you feel
the urge to get out as quickly as possible, before they decide you are not
worthy of their company.

The coldness of this room is not generated by the weather, but by its
inhabitants.  They are completely disciplined, not even blinking or
twitching a muscle.  After staring at these not-quite-human forms, you feel
the urge to get out as quickly as possible, before they decide you are not
worthy of their company.

#0It seems you've stumbled into the catacombs, below the eye of immortality.
The fire that blazes within the hollowed out center of this large cavern
like room is unnaturally bright, its flames twisting and flaring wildly as
if threatening to engulf the room at any moment. Next to the fire is a large,
immensely detailed fountain that looks to be made of a smoky and dark glass.
The sparkling clear water that trickles down the tiers of the fountain is
relaxing, almost mesmerizing. The bottom portion of the fountain is made of
an oval bowl of sorts that is followed by a smaller version of itself over
top of it, which all hover there by themselves, perhaps an illusion or trick.#n

#0A deep, shiny black marble covers the floor, with bits of yellow
light running through it like electric currents. The walls are
made of exquisitely detailed black marble also, but the framework
is carved to look like twisted faces of the dying. Its gleam and
deep, jet black color that runs with blood red threads makes it
seem as if the faces are real, not just someone's imaginings.
The ceiling seems to be made of a flexing eight-sided mirror
that catches the faces and fractures them into dancing sparks.#n

A colossial stone archway grants entrance to this grand plaza where many
villagers gather for local commerce.  The swirl of several different odors
coupled with the din of the crowd is overwhelming.  People are huddled
around the many shops which lie on either side, parting a way to the center
of a distant building.
