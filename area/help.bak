0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~

Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

#C      'autostance'.
~
8 ALLOW BAN~

Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with

the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

-1 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~

Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

0 'CALL LIGHTNING'~

Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.
It calls down lightning bolts from God.
~
-1 CAST~

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

times and in many different styles.  Below is an explanation of how to play,
the rules, and the prizes.  
 
#0Capture The Flag is played quite simply.  There can be up to 4 teams in the arena, 2 people minimum in each team.
The objective is to steal the other teams flag, and return to your base before they catch you and steal -your- teams flag.#n
#0The winning team is the team that has both their and the opposing teams flags in their base.#n
 
#RRules:#0
1)No PK unless specified by Imm, this is not only PK'er but also newbie friendly so don't go around attacking others.
2)Do not use the steal skill to get the flag from either the Flag Guardian, or another player.  You must actually -kill- the guardian to obtain the flag.
Alternately, use the Cflag command to retrieve the flag from an opponent. DO NOT SPAM CFLAG!!!
 
3) Follow all other rules set out by imm, as this is a heavily adaptable game and can be modified to suit different scenarios.
 
#GTiers:#g
1) Easy: For newbies and veterens alike, this version is truely easy and fun, prizes are small but still prizes.
2) Medium: Slightly harder then Easy but still do-able by newbies.  The prizes for this tier are the standard prizes.
3) Hard: This is recommended for people with at least a 1-2k PR, the mobs won't play very nicely and Morting may be allowed.
4) RFH: Stands for "Really Fucking Hard" Expect the guardians to pimpslap you, no matter what your strength.  The prizes for this tier are the best, however they are also the hardest to obtain.
 
#CPrizes:#c
Easy: Winning team: 2k QP's to all team members.
Medium: Winning Team: 4k QP's to all team members and 1 slab of electrum.

Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>        Must wield a weapon.

you may leech some of that primal from them when you decap.  Your victim
will not go below 20,000 primal.

your victim.  If you are above 10 status, you will only gain status 75%
of the time.

Note: Above 10 status there is a small chance of obtaining 2 status for
a decapitation.

-1 EXPERIENCE XP~

Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the players legend and the level
of the mob being killed. There are also different modifiers like
double exp and newbie exp.
 
When a player gets 1 legend, he or she starts getting a legend
bonus when mobs are killed, and the amount of extra exp gained,
increases for each legend that player has.
 
Until a player get a certain power rating, that player gains 3x the
normal exp, and should an immortal feel like it, he or she has
the ability to turn on double exp, which doubles the experience
gained when killing a mob. Do NOT ask an immortal for double exp.
You may also turn double exp on for 3000qps with the '#Cbuy exp#n' command.

0 MONKABILITIES~

Monks have four special abilities granted to them by God.
Each ability has four levels, which cost 500k exp each.
For more info on the Abilities,
See Help: 'MONKSPIRIT' 'MONKCOMBAT' 'MONKBODY' and 'MONKAWARENESS'
~
0 MONKAWARENESS~

Level 1 - Nightsight

Level 2 - Shadowsight

Level 3 - Truesight

Level 4 - Scry
~
0 MONKBODY~

Level 1 - Adamantium Hands.  This power allows the monk's hands to become
incredibly hard, like adamantium.  This allows the monk to do more damage
and parry blows with his or her bare hands.

Level 2 - Body of Stone (Auto).  At this mastery of the body, the monk's
body is as hard as a stone, causing him or her to take reduced damage.

Level 3 - Spiritpower.  This power allows the monk to channel his or her
energy into offensive attacks, significantly raising his or her hitroll
and damroll.

Level 4 - The Glow (Auto).  Only a true master of the body has this
ability.  The monk's power is so great that his or her hands glow
brightly with the power of God and the monk's holy spirit.  The 
effect of this glow is varied, but often dangerous.
~
0 MONKCHI~

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~
0 MONKCOMBAT~

This ability improves the monk's combat ability per level.
Each level gives the monk more knowledge of combat,
allowing him or her to do more damage, hit more often, and
parry and dodge more.
~
0 MONKCOMBO~

By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.
EXAMPLE-Thrust,Thrust,Spin
~
0 MONKFOCUS~

Elite monks have the ability to focus the power of God
into his or her own special attacks.  After a monk has
gained focus points, he or she must use them to perform
special attacks that have devastating effects.  The only
downside to these attacks is that it takes a monk a
very long time to recover the focus required to do such
extraordinary feats.
Focus is now a deciding factor in achieving CHI levels.
in order to use chi you must have focus points.
~
0 MONKSPIRIT~

Level 1 - Blinding Agony. This power allows the monk to hurl
a ball of pure evil at a foe.  It blinds the foe, and prevents
him or her to flee or recall.

Level 2 - Natural Harmony (auto).  This power allows the monk to
absorb the evil of someone who attacks him or her and channel
them into energy, which heals the Monk.

Level 3 - Healing Touch.  This power allows the monk to imbue his
target with the essence of God, healing his or her wounds.

Level 4 - Death Touch. This power allows the monk to give his victim a
deadly disease which cripples and wounds him or her.

the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

0 PRIMAL~

Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one

For those who can afford it, primal can be trained above 20000 with the
'train' commannd.
 - 20000 to 40000 primal   = +100 damcap.
 - 40000 to 60000 primal   = +200 damcap.
 - 60000 to 80000 primal   = +300 damcap.
 - 80000 to 100000 primal  = +400 damcap.
 - 100000 to 150000 primal = +500 damcap.
 - 150000 to 200000 primal = +600 damcap.
 - 200000 to 300000 primal = +700 damcap.
 - 300000 to 400000 primal = +800 damcap.
 - 400000 to 500000 primal = +900 damcap.
 - 500000 primal          = +1000 damcap.

Note:  When you decapitate somebody, if you have over 20k primal
and they also have over 20k primal, you will 'steal' some of their
primal.  When doing so, your victim will not go below 20k primal.

favoured setups.  However, to get you going, here are some examples:

Original normal prompt: [%x exp] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Original combat prompt: [%f] <%h/%Hhp %m/%Mm %v/%Vmv>
Simple prompt: [%hH/%mM/%vV]
Vampire prompt: [%B Blood] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Werewolf prompt: [%R Rage] <%hhp %mm %vmv>
Combat prompt: [%N:%F/%n:%f]
Stat prompt: [%xX] [+%pHIT/+%PDAM] [%cAC] [%hH/%mM/%vV]

Remember, you can switch between the default prompts and your customised
prompts with 'prompt on' and 'prompt off'.  Doing this will not destroy 
your customised prompts.
~
0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.
<<*>> #rFlamehands#n This power erupts your hands into flames.
<<*>> #rEarthmeld#n Allows you to sink into the ground hiding from enemies.
<<*>> #rClaws#n Enables the user to grow inch-long claws on each finger.  These 
      claws have no effect if the vampire is armed, however if not they cause 
      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.

~
-1 QUEST-TYPES~

The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.

1 SEDIT~

sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings 
that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and 
sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case 
of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X 
types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.


So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you 
would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you

confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

#CNote: See also help on 'advancedstance', 'stancetable', 'superstances',
#C      and 'autostance'.

-1 STATUS~

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of

Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum by legend).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

Remember, if your status is Immortal or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Avatar (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).

0 SUPERSTANCES~

When you have grandmastered all you normal stances, you can create your
own stances with the setstance command. The setstance command will tell
you how to create a new stance, and how much xp it costs; but beware,
once you have finished your superstance, your stuck with it forever.
Also notice that you won't get any extra powers by chosing the same
power several times, even if you choose both lesser and greater version,
it's just a waste of xp.

You get four superstances, and most likely you won't use super stance 1-4
so don't spend to much on those.

Enjoy. 

#CNote: To autostance into a superstance, type autostance ss#, where # is
#C      stance you want to drop into. EXAMPLE: autostance ss2

'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

untie themself.

tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.

damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have

0 inquisitor~

Inquisitors were once holy priests, until the desire to purify the corrupt

  1. Purify 		- Purification through pain.  Heals you.
  2. Torture		- Damage your victim over time.
  3. Torment		- Cause your victim adverse affects while fighting.
  4. Chains		- Bind your victim in chains to prevent fleeing.
  5. Unholyfury		- Twice normal damcap, chains don't work.  Timer.

Inquisitors are inborn with the knowledge of:
  1. Inquire            - Class Channel
  2. Truesight		- See stuff.
  3. Unholyritual	- Learn inquisitor powers.
  4. Hunt		- Hunt swiftly!
  5. Staff		- Create your own weapon!
  6. Enlist		- Help enlist
 
Inquisitors require maximum weapon levels for true effectiveness.
