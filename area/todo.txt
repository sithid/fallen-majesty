1058690649 Sun Jul 20 03:44:09 2003~ snard~  ~ questmaster mob that will set a bit on a player, with a timer, and the player has a certain amount of time to kill a specific mob, which would be flagged with medit/mset.  The player would have to pay for the service in qp or gold, and would recieve a bounty of QP from the questmaster upon completion.  Could make all these mobs also by default make the room private to anybody who is not the questor, so that nobody may help one achieve qp this way.  Would allow for nice prizes~
1058692173 Sun Jul 20 04:09:33 2003~ snard~  ~ addition to questmaster item:  can have the questmaster load a mob and trans the player to a battle arena, with a mob that for a price in coins will heal some of your wounds.  The quest-mob you are to victimize would be created with stats according to the amount of coins you bid against the questmaster.~
