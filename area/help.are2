0 ADVANCEDSTANCE~

Syntax: combat <style>

Advanced stances can be learned after you have become a grand master in 
two normal stances.  These stances are much better than the others.
MANTIS: Requires CRANE and VIPER before it can be learned.  This stance 
combines a very strong defence with lightning fast counter attacks.
DRAGON: Requires BULL and CRAB before it can be learned.  This stance 
uses very powerful attacks, as well as protecting the fighter from injury.
TIGER: Requires BULL and VIPER before it can be learned.  Probably the 
most aggressive of all the stances, this style utilizes very powerful and
lightning fast attacks.
MONKEY: Requires CRANE and MONGOOSE before it can be learned.  The only 
affect of this stance is to completely nullify the advantages of your 
opponents stance.
SWALLOW: Requires MONGOOSE and CRAB before it can be learned.  This is 
the most defensive of all the stances, combining agile dodges with the 
ability to 'roll' with an attack, helping prevent injury.

~
8 ALLOW BAN~

Syntax: allow   <site>
Syntax: ban     <site>
Syntax: ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list.

The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

Site bans are not saved; every time the server is rebooted, the site
ban list is cleared.

commands both use the same 'question' channel

-1 BACKSTAB BERSERK BS DISARM KICK PUNCH KILL~

Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: berserk
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: punch    <character>
Syntax: kill     <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room.  It will 
hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
while you are grouped.
DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
short period of time.  It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
nose or jaw.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

0 BEAST~

Vampires, like mortals, are creatures of instinct.  However, the 
instincts of the vampire are those of a hunter, not a gatherer.  Vampires 
are the ultimate predators and stand at the apex of the food chain.  
They are highly developed killing machines - the harbringers of death.
For vampires to survive in modern society, however, they must learn to 
keep the Beast in check.  The instincts of violence (the Beast) so 
essential in the wild serve only to endanger the vampire in today's 
complex world.  The Beast's rage has its uses, but the blindness it 
creates far outweighs its benefits.
Vampires struggle to suppress the Beast, but, no matter how hard they 
try, they do not always prevail, and when it gets loose, the havoc it 
creates goes far beyond the horror of any mortal rage.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

Syntax: cast 'call lightning'

This spell works only out of doors, and only when the weather is bad.

~
-1 CAST~

Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your magical ability increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with you.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is half of your 
current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.

Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).

hungry you can even crack the skull and eat their brains ;)
Decapitation alone is not enough to completely destroy another avatar 
however, for their head will retain their remaining lifeforce.  To truely 
kill them, you must crack open their head and eat (or in some other way 
destroy) their brain.

Syntax: decap <victim>        Must wield a weapon.

0 ESCAPE~

This command allows you to transport to the temple of midgaard when

-1 EXPERIENCE XP~

#n #n
Experience is gained by killing mobs, the amount of experience
gained through a kill depends on the players status and the level
of the mob being killed. There are also different modifiers like
double exp and newbie exp.

When a player gets 1 status, he or she  start getting a status 
bonus when you kill mobs, and the amount of extra exp gained,
increases for each 5 status that player has.

The first 4 hours of a players "life", that player gain 3x the
normal exp, and should an immortal feel like it, he or she has
the ability to turn on double exp, which doubles the experience
gained when killing a mob. Do NOT ask an immortal for double exp.

without permission is known as an Anarch.

other vampires the ability to sire more vampires still.  Only an 
Antediluvian has the power to make some a prince (or to remove the 
prince's powers).

possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages.  Your first 
attack in combat always uses the first number slot.  If you have a second 
attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4.  If you 
have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
8.  Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8.  If

is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

In order to RESCUE successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

join the fight.

kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west).  You cannot 
hurl someone who is already injured.

0 LICH~

#GLichs are powerful sorceres that have cheated death by entering a state of
living death. No longer subject to the affects of time, they use their time
to explore other planes and perfect their magic. The lichs grow in power, far
beyond that of most mortal mages, since they have so much more time to perfect
their art. If you thought mages were scary, try fighting a lich that has used
the last 2000 years comming up with nasty spells to kill and destroy.

Masters of conjuring, death, life, necromantics and chaos, lichs have
acces to several powers, some of them are know as :

#0* #GConjuring   #8: #0Objectgate, Fireball, Planartravel, Golemsummon, Pentagram.#n
#0* #GDeath       #8: #0Readaura, Chillhand, Scry, Painwreck, Creeping Doom.#n

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

character at a time.

0 MONKABILITIES~

Monks have four special abilities granted to them by God.
Each ability has four levels, which cost 500k exp each.
For more info on the Abilities,
See Help: 'MONKSPIRIT' 'MONKCOMBAT' 'MONKBODY' and 'MONKAWARENESS'
~
0 MONKAWARENESS~

Level 1 - Nightsight

Level 2 - Shadowsight

Level 3 - Truesight

Level 4 - Scry
~
0 MONKBODY~

Level 1 - Adamantium Hands.  This power allows the monk's hands to become
incredibly hard, like adamantium.  This allows the monk to do more damage
and parry blows with his or her bare hands.

Level 2 - Body of Stone (Auto).  At this mastery of the body, the monk's
body is as hard as a stone, causing him or her to take reduced damage.

Level 3 - Spiritpower.  This power allows the monk to channel his or her
energy into offensive attacks, significantly raising his or her hitroll
and damroll.

Level 4 - The Glow (Auto).  Only a true master of the body has this
ability.  The monk's power is so great that his or her hands glow
brightly with the power of God and the monk's holy spirit.  The 
effect of this glow is varied, but often dangerous.
~
0 MONKCHI~

A monk's chi is the essential part of combat.  The higher
the monk's chi, the better he or she can parry and dodge
blows.  It also gives the monk more strength and power,
thus letting him or her inflict more damage and receive
less.  Maintaining chi is very strenuous, and requires
that the monk have plenty of vitality.
~
0 MONKCOMBAT~

This ability improves the monk's combat ability per level.
Each level gives the monk more knowledge of combat,
allowing him or her to do more damage, hit more often, and
parry and dodge more.
~
0 MONKCOMBO~

By using his or her special techniques, such as thrust kick,
in a certain order, he or she may perform special combos.
Each combo has a different effect.  Some may do damage to the
victim, some syphon movement points, and some may stun the victim.
A monk's combos are a very mysterious thing, thus the monk
must spend much of his or her life trying to perfect
these combos.
EXAMPLE-Thrust,Thrust,Spin
~
0 MONKFOCUS~

Elite monks have the ability to focus the power of God
into his or her own special attacks.  After a monk has
gained focus points, he or she must use them to perform
special attacks that have devastating effects.  The only
downside to these attacks is that it takes a monk a
very long time to recover the focus required to do such
extraordinary feats.
Focus is now a deciding factor in achieving CHI levels.
in order to use chi you must have focus points.
~
0 MONKSPIRIT~

Level 1 - Blinding Agony. This power allows the monk to hurl
a ball of pure evil at a foe.  It blinds the foe, and prevents
him or her to flee or recall.

Level 2 - Natural Harmony (auto).  This power allows the monk to
absorb the evil of someone who attacks him or her and channel
them into energy, which heals the Monk.

Level 3 - Healing Touch.  This power allows the monk to imbue his
target with the essence of God, healing his or her wounds.

Level 4 - Death Touch. This power allows the monk to give his victim a
deadly disease which cripples and wounds him or her.

are standing in plain view.  Though this Discipline affects others minds 
and does not actually render the users invisible, the end result is much 
the same.  Obfuscate is the opposing Discipline to Auspex, and they 
cancel out many of each others powers.

<<*>> #rMask#n Allows you to disguise yourself as another player.
<<*>> #rShield#n Protects you from the Auspex 'scry' and 'readaura' powers.
<<*>> #rMortal#n Switches between vampire and mortal mode.  While in mortal 
      form, you loose all vampire advantages and disadvantages, and are 
      undetectable from a normal mortal.
<<*>> #rVanish#n allows the player to be invisible to the common eye.
<<*>> #rConceal#n This power hides any object it is used on.

<<*>> #rShadowsight#n This power allows you to see in the Umbra.
<<*>> #rNightSight#n This power allows the kindred to see in the dark.
<<*>> #rShadowstep#n This allows you to step through the umbra without
      being seen and appear in front of your victim.
<<*>> #rLamprey#n This powerful ability allows you to shoot tendrils
      at your victim entraping them.

  denial, and removal of the exp earned botting +50%.
  NOTE : xp-botting is getting ANY xp while NOT typing the commands you self.

* No multiplaying or playersharing. Penalty is deletion of all chars involved.

* Be kind to newbies, being a total jerk to newbies are not tolerated.

  channel, spambitching on any of the other global channels is NOT
  allowed, and you'll most likely get silenced permanently if you do so.

0 PROTEAN~

This Discipline allows a vampire to transform either their entire body or 
a part of their body into something inhuman.  The vampire can thus grow 
claws, turn into a bat, transform into a wolf or dissolve into a fine 
mist.  A vampire can use most other Disciplines while shapeshifted, but 
may not cast spells.  Full transformation is not possible during combat, 
although claws can be grown if you are fighting.  While shapeshifted the 
vampire cannot wear any equipment.

      you to see any hidden charchter accept for monk and ninja.

      considerably more damage than a normal unarmed attack.
<<*>> #rChange#n Allow the vampire to transform into bat, wolf or mist.  Bat 
      form can fly and detect almost everything (invis, hidden, etc).  While in 
      wolf form, the vampire enjoys the benefit of an extra 500hp and greatly 
      enhanced combat abilities.  Mist form is impervious to attacks and can 
      pass through doors.  Beware though, for two vampires in mist form CAN 
      attack each other.

~
-1 QUEST-TYPES~

The following are a few examples of quest types:
* Find the object/s.  Examples: Find 5 different coloured potions, Find a 
  pitch black longsword that flames brightly, Find a dragon dagger, belt 
  and bracer, etc.
* Kill the mob/s.  These can be hunt down and kill, or simple placing the 
  player in the same room as the mob/s.  Can also be combined with finding 
  objects - Example: Find and kill two different dragons and bring me 
  their claws.
* Solve a puzzle.  For example find a certain room, solve a riddle in an 
  area, or successfully get out of a maze.  These are particularly good 
  when several players of different ability are competing in the quest.
* Duel: A one-on-one fight pitting either a player against a mob, or 
  (more usually) a player against another player.  The conditions will be 
  decided beforehand, and can include any conditions that both sides 
  agree on.  Example: No sanctuary, no potions (or maybe a limited number),
  no spells, no weapons, or whatever.
* Skirmishes: Like a duel, but involves several players on either side.  
  Although the sides don't have to be equal in number, it is generally a 
  good idea to make sure they are roughly equal in power.
* There are also several more obscure quests that can be run - for 
  example you could require that the player brings you 3 small green 
  eggs, then load mob 30005 into the players room.  Another battle might 
  involve no melee - all combat must be with missile weapons.

0 QUESTCARD COMPLETE RECHARGE~

the card you will be told that you have completed the card.  Then you

'recharge card machine'.  You will receive a quest token reward, which 
you should eat, and the card will be recharged with 4 new items to find.

HINT:  Vallandar's tomb can be found by going 2 south, 7 east, 2 north 
from recall.  Once you have found that area, you should look for the 
guardian and solve his riddle, enter the portal he creates, and you'll be 
in the dark crypt.
~
0 QUESTS~

Quest Makers (and occasionally higher levels) can set quests for one or 
more players to participate in.  The rewards for such quests can be in 
the form of specially modified equipment.  A number of quest points-worth 
will be allocated depending on the difficulty of the quest, using the 
following guidelines for point costs (QP's = Quest Points):

Stats (Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Con): 20 QP's per +1, max allowed is +3 per stat.
Hp/Mana/Move: 5 QP per +1, max allowed is +25 on each.
Hitroll/Damroll: 30 QP's per +1, max allowed is +5 on each.
Ac: 10 QP's per -1, max allowed is -25.

Once a certain affect (str, hitroll, ac, etc) is selected, it cannot be 
chosen again for that item even if you didn't select the maximum allowed 
amount.  Choosing to have penalties on an item will not decrease its 
cost, although some Quest Makers may allow extra points if you select a 
few disadvantages on the item.

For more information, type 'quest'.

0 SCAN SPY THROW~

Syntax: scan
Syntax: spy   <direction>
Syntax: throw <direction> <target>

SCAN allows you to see all the mobs/players within 1 room of you.

SPY allows you to see all the mobs/players within 3 rooms in a specified 
direction.

THROW allows you to hurl an object you are holding (in your right hand, 
or if that's empty left hand) to a target mob/player in a specified 
direction.  The object can be throw up to 3 rooms.  If it fails to reach 
the target by that time it will land on the floor.

For information on the SCAN spell, type 'help scanspell'.
~
0 SCANSPELL REPAIR~

Syntax: cast scan
Syntax: cast repair

The SCAN spell will tell you all the items you are carrying which are 
currently in need of repairing.

The REPAIR spell will repair all the items you are carrying which are

~
1 SEDIT~

Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings 
that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and 
sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case 
of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X 
types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.


So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you 
would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

0 STANCE~

Syntax: combat <style>

In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
confident of your ability.  Each fighting stance has advantages and 
disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
VIPER: A very fast and aggressive style of combat, concentrating on 
striking your opponent before they have the chance to avoid or block you.
CRANE: A wide, sweeping style of combat, which concentrates on a very 
strong blocking defence.
CRAB: A low, defensive fighting stance which uses agile footwork and 
rolling with attacks in order to reduce your injuries.
MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics to 
ensure that by the time your opponent makes their attack, you've moved 
out of the way.
BULL: A low aggressive stance which concentrates purely on physical power.

~
0 STANCETABLE~

~
-1 STATUS~

This represents the 'danger' of the player.  You only have a status if 
you are level 3.  It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure of 
how deadly that player is in combat.  Each time you decapitate an 
Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero).  The 
following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:

Remember, if your status is Immortal or above you gain nothing for 
decapitating an Avatar (except a free loot, a head, and an enemy).

~
0 SUPERSTANCES~

When you have grandmastered all you normal stances, you can create your
own stances with the setstance command. The setstance command will tell
you how to create a new stance, and how much xp it costs; but beware,
once you have finished your superstance, your stuck with it forever.
Also notice that you won't get any extra powers by chosing the same
power several times, even if you choose both lesser and greater version,
it's just a waste of xp.

You get four superstances, and most likely you won't use super stance 1-4
so don't spend to much on those.

Enjoy.

-1 TICK~

Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.


f these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

0 TIE UNTIE GAG BLINDFOLD~

Syntax: tie <target>
Syntax: untie <target>
Syntax: gag <target>
Syntax: blindfold <target>

TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
incapitated, or mortally wounded.  While tied up, a players actions are 
limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.

UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up.  A player cannot 
untie themself.

GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
tied up.  This command will also remove a gag.  A player can only remove 
a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up.  It is not possible 
to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.

BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
first be tied up.  The blindfold can also be removed with this command.  
A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
tied up.  Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.

0 TRAIN~

Syntax: train <str/int/wis/dex/con>
Syntax: train <avatar/mortal/primal/hp/mana/move>
Syntax: train <slash/stab/smash/beast/grab>
Syntax: train <charm/heat/cold/lightning/acid/sleep/drain/voodoo>
Syntax: train <hurl/backstab/kick/steal/disarm>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class.  You can increase 
your attributes by spending experience points (exp) at a trainer.

It costs 200 exp to train a stat (str, int, etc), except that it costs 
only 100 exp to train your primary stat.  Primal costs 500 exp for the 
first point, 1000 for the second, 1500 for the third, etc, and 
hp/mana/move cost your current amount in that particular area minus your 
con (for hp and move) or wis (for mana) per point.  Becoming a mortal or 
an avatar costs 1000 exp each.

You can also train weapon resistances (reduces between 1 and all of the 
damage per blow for that weapon type), spell immunities (those types 
of spell do no damage to you), and skill immunities (they no long have 
any affect on you).  These cost 10000 exp for the first, 20000 for the 
second, 30000 for the third, and so on.
~
5 TRANSFER~

Syntax: transfer <character>

0 TRANSPORT~

Syntax: cast transport <object> <character>

This spell will transport the specified object from your inventory to 
that of the specified character.
~
8 TRUST~

Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

the earth. Their forsaken souls are forever seeking wars and conflicts,
they live only to kill and cause pain.

6 USERS~

Syntax: users

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the channel
number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in merc.h:
0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.
~
0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~

Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
to daylight.  Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
blood.  If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
some blood in a drinking container.  Vampires take half damage from cold, 
none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
immunity take normal fire damage rather than double.  Other abilities:

* Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
* Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
* Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
* Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.

For more information type 'help disciplines'.

your message.

fights. Thus causing their enemies to drop all the equiptment worn on those
limb. These weapons are very useful, but have a higher vorpal rate class to
class.

his opponents limbs then a lich would.#n
~
0 VOODOO~

Syntax: Spell:   cast voodoo <victim>
        Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>

Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
First, a body part of the victim is needed.  The caster should hold this 
part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
room).  This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
commands on to interfere with the victim.
There are three voodoo actions.  The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance.  The second, 'Throw', will 
hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage.  The 
third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
destroy the doll itself.
~
0 WEAKEN~

Syntax: cast weaken <victim>
