clan ideas...
traps- for in the clan hall
customizable objects- made by clan forgers
mob guardians- imobile guards
healing rooms- purchaseable... we'll expand on this later
a single clan rare... in the clan_item wear_loc

expanding on ideas...
--------------------------------------
traps- traps will be costly and could do 1 of few things
... if a player stands in the room for like 5 seconds,
they get either
1)Damaged by some kinda blade trap (chance of knocking off some limbs)
2)Damaged and transported out
3)Stunned (Cheaper trap)
4)Poisoned (reserve affects)
5)Blinded

we could deal with costs later

Customizable objects...
These are eq pieces slightly stronger
then alignment eq, but not as strong as adamantiumeq
each clan will be able to have up to a set number of pieces (like 5-10)
their builder defines what these pieces look like and what pieces
they actually are.

Imobile guardians...
These are basicly guardians that will attack those not in the clan...
and if possible, able to be commanded to move around, as long as
they aren't moved outside of the clan hall
However, they would not move automatically towards any invaders...
nor do they set off infos, unless the player flees... if possible
.... and in any case of any infos, the info should be sent through
the clans ktalk

healing rooms/damaging rooms...
these are already coded, but maybe making extra bits, or a cloned bit
that makes it so it only heals the clan members and/or damage invaders
only (these should have a high cost... and have a limit of 2-3 each)

The single clan rare, built by the builder of the clan
the stats could be purchase-able, however, costly
and the max stats cannot be too high...
clan forgers are allowed to make these at a cost, determined
by how strong the rare is- also, only clan members can wear this
... bringing up the need of a "clan-only" or "anti-clan" bit...
